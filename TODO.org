* TODO New feature for Custom JQLs
Allows pulling results of custom JQL queries into custom buffer names.
** TODO Need to ensure mutations apply to the proper buffer (or at all)
Currently doing this will cause PROJ-KEY.org buffer to update, not the
custom JQL target.

This is also a problem because some chained functionality (pulling
worklog / comments) is derived from the proj-key and attempts are made
to switch to that active buffer (which is not active).

Everything running async doesn't help much either.
