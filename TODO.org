* TODO New feature for Custom JQLs
Allows pulling results of custom JQL queries into custom buffer names.
** TODO Need to ensure mutations apply to the proper buffer (or at all)
Currently doing this will cause PROJ-KEY.org buffer to update, not the
custom JQL target.

This is also a problem because some chained functionality (pulling
worklog / comments) is derived from the proj-key and attempts are made
to switch to that active buffer (which is not active).

Everything running async doesn't help much either.

* TODO Fix issue with org-jira-assign-issue
Priority id needs to be set to the number, not left as null or
whatever it's doing at the moment (may be a local issue due to using
priority caching stuff).

Also, org-jira-unassign-issue doesn't make sense as a distinct
command, Unassigned should be a valid choice on the re-assignment list.
