* org-jira mode

Use [[http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview/][Jira]] in Emacs org-mode.

For usage, please watch [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sp3h1Qlf4w][this youtube video]]. Or watch it on [[http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDc1NTIwOTY0.html][youku]] if
you can't visit youtube for some reason. My apologies beforehand if
you find the video too verbose and boring.

** External libraries

The [[http://code.google.com/p/emacs-soap-client/source/checkout][emacs-soap-client]] package is required, I used to bundle it
together with org-jira (because I had a patch for adding comments in
Chinese), but [[https://github.com/baohaojun/org-jira/issues/8][tarsius]] pointed out to me it is not a good idea. So
please install that package along with org-jira.

About the patch, I have submitted it [[http://code.google.com/p/emacs-soap-client/issues/detail?id=16&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Owner%20Summary][upstream]]. You can download it
from the [[http://emacs-soap-client.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=160000000&name=0001-Patch-for-soap-client.patch&token=0w4_XPg-Fe9sNqcTqgNP5RTXlXY%3A1359427017708][attachment url]] if it is not accepted yet.
